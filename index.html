  	<h2>Glossary / Jargon Buster</h2>
    	<p>
	    This page provides access to the Glossary / Jargon Buster that forms part of the GSE Induction Pack. We have designed this table to make it easy for new members to look up terms and phrases they might not have heard before joining the Profession. This table should help members, both new and old, navigate the terms, acronyms, and jargon frequently used in the GSE Profession. This will make the Profession more accessible and reduce the challenges faced by new members when joining.
	  </p> <p>    
	    For general terms that are used outside of the GSE Profession, please use the Civil Service Acronym Buster, which can be accessed <a href="https://samuel-hoskin.github.io/CS-Acronyms/?mc_cid=8c93ad9960&mc_eid=b3c48daf69">here</a>.
	    </p> <p>  
	    To use the Glossary / Jargon Buster, you can either scroll the table, or you can use the search bar below. Results are filtered automatically whilst you type.
